![gurl](https://github.com/DencoL/gurl/assets/24585973/39330b9f-75b3-450d-9402-3ef2addcc957)

gurl is TUI for [Hurl](https://github.com/Orange-OpenSource/hurl).

This is currently just side project, so who knows, what will come out of it.

# Features
- organize ```.hurl``` files
- organize environments (like dev, test, prod) with variables
- use ```.hurl``` files and execute Hurl command
- seeing the response

# Why
I wanted to work on something and I miss some sort of Postman-like TUI application. I also wanted to checkout some new language and Go with it's Bubbletea TUI library looked nice.
It's inspired by [hurlui](https://github.com/Kuchteq/hurlui).
